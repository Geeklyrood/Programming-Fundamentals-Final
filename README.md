\f0\fs24 \cf0 ##Text to Binary converter \
\
This is a program that I made for my Final for Programming Fundamentals. It takes your input from the text box and while you are typing output the Binary code that is equivalent to the text. The bottom half of this program will take a input of a Binary or Decimal number and output either the Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal or Octal representation of the number that was entered, depending on the drop down selection.\
